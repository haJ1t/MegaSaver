# `@megasaver/cli`

The `mega` command. Lives at `apps/cli/`. App, not library — no
public TypeScript export surface, only a bin entry. The `bin` field
in `apps/cli/package.json` maps `mega → ./dist/cli.js`.

## Current slice

### `mega doctor`

Three stateless checks (Node version ≥22, platform, cwd). Plain text
output, summary line, exit 0 on all-PASS, exit 1 on any FAIL.

### `mega project create <name>`

Creates a project in the store. Sets `rootPath = process.cwd()` and
stamps RFC 3339 `createdAt`/`updatedAt`. Prints `<id>  <name>` on
success. Rejects duplicate names with `error: project "<name>"
already exists` and exit 1.

### `mega project list`

Lists all projects as `<id>  <name>` lines, one per project.
Prints nothing (empty stdout) when the store is empty.

### `mega session create <projectName> --agent <id> [--risk medium] [--title "..."]`

Creates a session against an existing project resolved by name.
`--agent` is required (`claude-code | codex | cursor | generic-cli`),
`--risk` defaults to `medium`, `--title` is optional and stored
as `null` when omitted. Output is the new session id on stdout.

### `mega session list <projectName>`

Lists sessions for a project as `<id>  <agent>  <risk>  <title|->`,
two spaces between fields. Empty project → empty stdout.

### `mega session show <sessionId>`

Prints seven aligned `key=value` lines (12-char key column,
two-space gutter): `id`, `project`, `agent`, `risk`, `title`,
`startedAt`, `endedAt`. `null` fields render as `-`.

### `mega session end <sessionId>`

Stamps `endedAt` on an open session. Idempotency rejected by
design: a second call surfaces `error: session "<id>" already
ended at <ts>` and exits 1.

### `mega session update <sessionId> [--title "..."] [--risk medium] [--agent <id>]`

Partial update of an open session. At least one of `--title`,
`--risk`, `--agent` is required; otherwise the command exits 1
with `error: nothing to update`. `--title ""` clears the title to
`null` (matches `session create` accept-empty semantics). Ended
sessions are rejected with `session_already_ended`. Silent stdout
on success, exit 0.

### `mega connector sync <projectName> [--target <id>]`

Writes the Mega Saver context block into each known agent file
under the project's `rootPath`. v0.1 known targets:
- `claude-code` → `CLAUDE.md`
- `codex` → `AGENTS.md`
- `cursor` → `.cursor/rules/megasaver.mdc` (frontmatter prepended on first seed)

For each target the command reads the existing file, runs
`upsertBlock`, diff-checks against the existing content, and writes
only when the block changed. Files that do not yet exist are
silently `skipped` unless `--target <id>` opts in to seed exactly
that one. The session embedded in the block is the latest open
session whose `agentId` matches the target; `null` (`Session: none`)
when no match. Memory entries are empty in v0.1.

Status words on stdout: `wrote`, `noop`, `created`, `skipped`,
`error`. Best-effort partial failure: per-target errors emit on
stderr, the loop continues, exit 1 if any target failed.

### `mega connector status <projectName> [--target <id>]`

Read-only inspection of every known agent file under the project's
`rootPath`. Reuses the same `KNOWN_TARGETS` set as `sync` and the
same per-target latest-open-session rule. For each target the command
reads the file, runs `parseBlock`, and compares against the freshly
rendered block (`upsertBlock` predicate); the in-sync notion is
byte-identical to what `sync` would write.

Status words on stdout: `in-sync`, `drift`, `no-block`, `missing`,
`error`. Output line is `<id>  <relPath>  <status>  session=<id|none>`. Exit `0` when every line is `in-sync` or `missing`; exit
`1` if any line is `drift`, `no-block`, or `error`. Pre-loop failures
(project not found, unknown target, project root missing)
short-circuit before any line is emitted.

### Store resolution

Default store: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/megasaver` (fallback
`~/.local/share/megasaver`). macOS and Linux only in v0.1;
Windows deferred. `--store <dir>` is declared on each `project`
subcommand; it appears after the subcommand chain, e.g.
`mega project list --store /tmp/x`.

On first use against an uninitialized directory the CLI calls
`initStore` (from `@megasaver/core`) which creates `rootDir`,
`projects.json`, and `sessions.json` without overwriting existing
files. A one-time notice is printed to stderr:
`note: initialized store at <path>`.

### Error handling

Every typed core error is caught and funneled to a single exit 1
path (`errors.ts`). No typed error is silently swallowed.

## Dev invocation

`pnpm exec mega` does NOT resolve at the workspace root. pnpm v9 only
symlinks a workspace package's bin when another package depends on it.
Canonical dev loop:

```bash
pnpm --filter @megasaver/cli build
node apps/cli/dist/cli.js project list --store /tmp/demo-store
```

## Boundary rules

- No public library export; `private: true`.
- The CLI imports `@megasaver/core` for store and registry operations.
- `doctor` remains stateless; no store interaction.
- Pure functions accept injected parameters so tests avoid mocking
  `process` globals.

## Risk

Risk HIGH (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-06-cli-project-crud-design.md`).
Full superpowers chain applied; code-reviewer and critic passes
required before merge.
