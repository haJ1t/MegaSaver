# `@megasaver/mcp-bridge`

Real MCP server over `stdio` (AA1 §8; BB8, CRITICAL). Replaced the
v0.3 `not_implemented` placeholder without redesigning the
`createBridge(config)` API (source: AA1 §8). Shipped BB8 (PR #83,
`0e9be7a`).

## Tools (alphabetic; AA1 §8a)

- `mega_fetch_chunk(chunkSetId, chunkId, around?)` — drill into a
  stored excerpt.
- `mega_read_file(path, intent, sessionId, maxBytes?)` —
  `policy.evaluatePathRead` → `resolveSafeReadPath` → `readFile` →
  `filterOutput` → store.
- `mega_recall(sessionId, intent, maxBytes?)` — reload session memory
  + recent tool calls.
- `mega_run_command(command, args, intent, sessionId, maxBytes?)` —
  `evaluateCommand` (env-marker re-entry guard) → spawn → redact →
  filter → store + stats. Same orchestrator as `mega output exec`
  (source: AA1 §8d "one orchestrator, two entry points").

## Closed enums (AA1 §17)

- `McpToolName` (4 members), pinned in
  `packages/mcp-bridge/test/tool-name.test-d.ts`.
- `McpBridgeErrorCode` (16 members; replaced the single
  `not_implemented`), pinned in
  `packages/mcp-bridge/test/errors.test-d.ts`.
- `McpTransport = ["stdio", "sse"]` (unchanged; `sse` rejects until a
  later release).

## Setup surface (BB8 + BB11)

`McpSetupOps` (`buildMcpSetupOps`) drives `install` / `repair` /
`status` / `uninstall`, each returning a fresh `McpStatusResult`
(`{ agents: McpAgentStatus[] }`). Consumed by the CLI
`mega mcp {install,repair,status,uninstall}` and the GUI
AgentSetupDoctor `/api/mcp/*` routes.

## Boundaries

Does not import the CLI (`KnownAgentId` is declared here; the CLI
passes a validated id in). The GUI/CLI inject the `connectorSync`
side-effect (AA1 §2c DI).
