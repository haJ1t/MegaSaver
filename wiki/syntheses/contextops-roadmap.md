# ContextOps Roadmap — Phases 0–10 (reconciled)

The strategic product roadmap for Mega Saver as an **AI Coding Agent
Memory & Context Operating Layer**, reconciled against the shipped
v1.1.0 codebase as of main commit `0db235b` (this roadmap itself lives
on branch `docs/contextops-roadmap-phases`). Source: the Phase 0–10 roadmap
ingested at [[sources/roadmap-phases-v2]] (Desktop
`MegaSaver_Roadmap.txt`, 2026-06-11).

Each phase below carries a **reconciled status** — `done` / `partial`
/ `gap` — derived from a 22-agent code audit (map + adversarial
verify, 2026-06-11). Statuses are framed against the *new roadmap
vision*, not the locked v0.1/v1.0 specs. Where a phase looks "done
against the old spec but partial against the vision," both framings
are noted — that distinction is the whole point of reconciliation.

## Positioning

> Mega Saver is a self-improving context layer for AI coding agents.
> It remembers project decisions, prunes irrelevant code, learns from
> failed runs, and gives agents only the context and tools they need.

This is the same ContextOps thesis as [[concepts/contextops]], now
extended with three borrowed patterns:

- **DIMMEM** — structured, typed engineering memory (Phase 1).
  See [[concepts/structured-memory-engine]].
- **LAMR** — task-aware context pruning (Phase 3).
  See [[concepts/context-pruning-engine]].
- **FORGE** — failed-run → reusable-rule learning (Phase 5).

## Reconciled phase status

| Phase | Title | Status | Net-new gap |
|-------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 0 | Foundation | partial | `mega init`, SQLite (both deferred-by-design) |
| 1 | Structured Memory (DIMMEM) | partial | typed schema + search + MCP tools |
| 2 | Semantic Repo Index | gap | CodeBlock + AST + `mega scan/index` |
| 3 | Context Pruning (LAMR) | partial | task-aware scoring + `mega context` |
| 4 | MCP Server | partial | memory/rules/context tools (ride on 1/2/5) |
| 5 | Failed Run Learning (FORGE) | gap | FailedAttempt + ProjectRule + `mega fail/learn` |
| 6 | Task Decomposition | gap | TaskPlan/TaskStep + `mega task` |
| 7 | Tool Router | gap | ToolDefinition + `route_tools_for_task` |
| 8 | Audit Dashboard | partial | file/block/rule/memory/retry metrics + `mega audit` |
| 9 | Multi-Agent Connectors | done (vscode/jetbrains deferred) | `mega connect` alias deferred |
| 10 | Team/Cloud | gap | everything (team, approval, sync, PR comments) |

## Phase detail

### Phase 0 — Foundation · partial
Done: pnpm monorepo (15 buildable units), JSON store
(`JsonDirectoryCoreRegistry`, fsync-durable, Windows-safe), `mega
doctor`, `mega project create/list`. Gap: `mega init` (deferred
per `2026-05-06-cli-project-crud-design.md` §11) and the SQLite
backend (deferred per `2026-05-05-core-persistence-design.md` §4).
Both are intentional backlog, not bugs. See [[entities/core]],
[[entities/cli]].

### Phase 1 — Structured Memory Engine (DIMMEM) · partial
Done-against-v0.1-spec: `MemoryEntry` (id, projectId, sessionId,
scope, content, createdAt), append-only CRUD, `mega memory
create/list/show`, `mega_recall` MCP retrieval. The v0.1 spec
(`2026-05-09-memory-entry-cli-design.md` §2) explicitly deferred the
rich schema — so the verifier marks it "done" against that spec. But
the **roadmap vision** wants typed engineering memory: a 10-member
`MemoryType` union, `confidence`/`source`/`keywords`/`relatedFiles`/
`stale`/`expiresAt`, plus `search`/`delete`/`update`/`explain` CLI and
`save_memory`/`search_memory`/`get_relevant_memories` MCP tools. None
of that exists → **partial** against the vision. This is the #1
priority and the first full spec+plan
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-11-phase1-structured-memory-engine-design.md`).
Concept: [[concepts/structured-memory-engine]]. See [[entities/core]].

### Phase 2 — Semantic Repo Index · gap
No code-block / AST indexing exists. Primitives available:
`@megasaver/retrieval` (BM25 ranking, `deriveIntent`) and
`@megasaver/content-store` (ChunkSet persistence). Net-new:
`CodeBlock` schema (function/class/component/route/test/config/
schema/docs), AST extraction (TS/JS/Markdown/JSON), `mega scan`,
`mega index build/status/search/show`. Priority #2; full spec+plan at
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-11-phase2-semantic-repo-index-design.md`.
Concept: [[concepts/semantic-repo-index]]. See [[entities/retrieval]],
[[entities/content-store]].

### Phase 3 — Context Pruning (LAMR) · partial
Done: the [[concepts/context-gate-pipeline]] (redact→chunk→rank→fit→
summarize) in `@megasaver/output-filter` (9 rank features) +
`@megasaver/context-gate` orchestrator + BM25. But it is
**output-centric** (compresses one tool's stdout), not **task-aware
repo pruning**. Net-new: the LAMR scoring model (semanticRelevance +
dependencyRelevance + testFailureRelevance + recentEditRelevance +
memoryRelevance + userMentionRelevance − stalePenalty − noisePenalty),
`mega context build --task / explain / audit / export`, and structured
6–8-block output with per-block reasons. Priority #3; depends on
Phase 2 (needs CodeBlocks to score). Full spec+plan at
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-11-phase3-context-pruning-lamr-design.md`.
Concept: [[concepts/context-pruning-engine]]. See [[entities/output-filter]],
[[entities/context-gate]].

### Phase 4 — MCP Server · partial
Done: real stdio bridge, 16-code error taxonomy, 4 locked tools
(`mega_fetch_chunk`, `mega_read_file`, `mega_recall`,
`mega_run_command`), `mega mcp serve/install/repair/status/uninstall`.
The 4-tool surface is locked by AA1 (`2026-05-10-aa1-context-gate-epic.md`
§8a) — verifier calls it "done" there. The roadmap's wider surface
(`get_project_context`, `search_memory`, `save_memory`,
`get_relevant_memories`, `get_relevant_code_blocks`,
`record_failed_attempt`, `save_project_rule`, `get_project_rules`)
rides on Phases 1/2/5 and is **gap**. Sequence: ship the engines
first, then expose them as MCP tools. See [[entities/mcp-bridge]].

### Phase 5 — Failed Run Learning (FORGE) · gap
Nothing exists. Primitives: `@megasaver/policy` (command/path gating),
core error taxonomy, `@megasaver/stats`. Net-new: `FailedAttempt` and
`ProjectRule` schemas, `mega fail record`, `mega learn from-failure`,
`mega rules list/add/apply`, failure-similarity search, and warning
injection into the context pack. Self-improving differentiator;
depends on Phase 1 (rules are a `MemoryType`) and Phase 3 (warnings go
in the pack). Risk: HIGH (new failure data model, stores error
output → privacy). See [[entities/policy]].

### Phase 6 — Task Decomposition · gap
Nothing exists. Net-new: `TaskPlan`/`TaskStep` schemas (step types
scan/retrieve_context/plan/edit/test/debug/document/save_memory,
`dependsOn`), `mega task plan/run/status/retry/explain`, a step
executor, dependency resolver, and the key behavior — **retry only
the failed step + its debug step, not the whole workflow**. Depends on
Phases 1–3 (steps call memory/index/context) and 5 (failed steps
become `FailedAttempt`s). See [[entities/core]].

### Phase 7 — Tool Router · gap
Nothing exists. Primitives: `@megasaver/policy` (dangerous-pattern
deny), `RiskLevel` enum, skill-pack capabilities. Net-new:
`ToolDefinition` schema (category + risk), `mega tools
index/list/route/explain`, and `route_tools_for_task(task)` returning
`{allowedTools, blockedTools, reason}`. Dual win: fewer tool schemas
in context (tokens) + dangerous tools blocked (safety). See
[[entities/policy]].

### Phase 8 — Audit Dashboard · partial
Done: `@megasaver/stats` (TokenSaverEvent byte metrics:
rawBytes/returnedBytes/bytesSaved/savingRatio, secrets redacted, chunks
stored), `mega session saver stats`, GUI `TokenSaverStats`. The
verifier marks the *Audit Dashboard* itself a gap — the shipped stats
are token-byte only. Net-new metrics: filesConsidered/Included/
Excluded, blocksConsidered/Included/Excluded, repeatedFailuresAvoided,
rulesApplied, memoriesRetrieved, toolSchemasReduced, retryCostSaved;
plus `mega audit / audit last / session / export / report` and a
dashboard view. This is the "prove the savings" surface — depends on
Phases 1/2/3/5/7 emitting their counts. See [[entities/stats]],
[[entities/gui]].

### Phase 9 — Multi-Agent Connectors · done (vscode/jetbrains deferred)
Done (Phase 9, branch `feat/phase9-connectors`, 2026-06-12): three new
flat-file targets `geminiTarget` (`GEMINI.md`), `windsurfTarget`
(`.windsurfrules`), `continueTarget` (`.continue/rules/megasaver.md`)
shipped in `@megasaver/connector-generic-cli` (`builtinTargets` 3→6);
`agentIdSchema` widened 5→8; CLI `KNOWN_TARGETS` now 7 entries;
`mega connector list` (known targets + present/absent, exit 0) and
`mega connector doctor` (exists/writable/in-sync diagnostic, 6 status
words, exit 1 on stale/not-writable/error) added. Cross-agent shared
memory proven by integration test (project memory lands byte-identically
in CLAUDE.md + GEMINI.md). GUI bridge/badges/session-forms updated.
Deferred: `vscode`/`jetbrains` (native IDE plugins), `mega connect`
alias. The four shipped targets (`claude-code`/`codex`/`cursor`/`aider`)
are byte-identical.
See [[entities/connectors-generic-cli]], [[entities/connectors-claude-code]],
[[entities/cli]].

### Phase 10 — Team/Cloud · gap
Nothing exists; single-developer, single-project today. Net-new: team
shared memory, memory permissions, approval flow, cloud sync, org
rules, audit logs, GitHub PR memory comments. Explicitly future per
fikri §15.4. The local→SaaS transition; out of scope until Phases 1–9
prove the local product.

## Reconciled priority (net-new work)

Roadmap's stated order (1 Memory → 2 Index → 3 Pruning → 4 MCP →
5 FORGE → 6 Task → 7 Router → 8 Audit → 9 Connectors → 10 Team) holds
after reconciliation, with these dependency notes:

1. **Phase 1 (DIMMEM)** — unblocks 4, 5, 6, 8. Start here.
2. **Phase 2 (Repo Index)** — unblocks 3, 4, 8.
3. **Phase 3 (LAMR)** — needs 2; unblocks 6, 8.
4. **Phase 4 (MCP tools)** — thin layer once 1/2 land.
5. **Phase 5 (FORGE)** — needs 1; unblocks 6, 8.
6. **Phase 6 (Task)** — needs 1/2/3/5.
7. **Phase 7 (Router)** — independent; can slot anytime after 4.
8. **Phase 8 (Audit)** — needs 1/2/3/5/7 to emit counts; do last of MVP.
9. **Phase 9 (Connectors)** — independent; incremental.
10. **Phase 10 (Team/Cloud)** — after local product proven.

**MVP (roadmap v0.3 target):** Phases 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 (+ basic 8) — the
demo loop "fix the login bug" → search memory → scan blocks → build
compact context → save fix as memory → show token saving.

## Planning artifacts

Full spec + plan written for the three near-term gap phases (1, 2, 3):

- Phase 1: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-11-phase1-structured-memory-engine-design.md`
  + `…/plans/2026-06-11-phase1-structured-memory-engine-plan.md`
- Phase 2: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-11-phase2-semantic-repo-index-design.md`
  + `…/plans/2026-06-11-phase2-semantic-repo-index-plan.md`
- Phase 3: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-11-phase3-context-pruning-lamr-design.md`
  + `…/plans/2026-06-11-phase3-context-pruning-lamr-plan.md`

Phases 4–10 stay roadmap-level here; each gets its own spec+plan via
the [[concepts/superpowers-discipline]] chain when scheduled.

## Relationship to the existing backlog

This roadmap **supersedes the framing** of
[[syntheses/post-v1.1-roadmap]] for product direction (that page
remains the source of truth for v1.1 cleanup: npm publish, GUI
packaging, i18n). The fikri §16 "Repo Scanner / Memory Vault / Token
Audit" backlog items map onto Phases 2 / 1 / 8 respectively.
