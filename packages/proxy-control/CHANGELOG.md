# @megasaver/proxy-control

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 297ebc2: Persistent proxy routing: one explicit CLI/GUI action persistently enables the
  local proxy for future supported Claude launches, owned by a dedicated
  supervisor LaunchAgent that reconciles desired↔actual state and never touches a
  foreign route or a process it did not start. Fixes the 2026-07-02 finding where
  the proxy was healthy but no client was routed (zero metering), and removes the
  GUI's boot/shutdown route-clearing that could strand a session.

  - `@megasaver/llm-proxy`: a nonce-bound ownership health endpoint (HMAC
    challenge-response) answered in-process and never forwarded upstream.
  - `@megasaver/proxy-control` (NEW, agent-agnostic): strict versioned control/
    runtime state stores; fenced owner identity + locks (pid + start-token +
    boot-id, PID-reuse-safe); the reconciliation recovery matrix as a pure,
    exhaustively-tested decision (a foreign route is never removed, no route is
    applied in a disable/drain transition, remove targets only a leased exact
    owned url); supervisor wiring (startup fixpoint + 5s monitor); and a macOS
    LaunchAgent adapter (structured plist, legacy-service-present manual bootout,
    idempotent-by-observation, foreign untouched).
  - `@megasaver/connector-claude-code`: a value-guarded Claude route adapter
    (inspect/apply/removeExpected/ensureHooks) that owns the `~/.claude/settings.json`
    route and never overwrites/removes a foreign value.
  - `@megasaver/cli`: `mega proxy start` (persist an enable intent + install the
    supervisor LaunchAgent), `stop` (enter drain) and `stop
--confirm-clients-restarted` (finish drain: stop the listener + reach terminal
    idle), `status [--json]` (read-only; separated facts + saver liveness from the
    heartbeat registry), `service uninstall --confirm`,
    and the internal `proxy supervise` daemon. The daemon binds a health-capable
    loopback listener and runs the reconcile state machine on a 5s cadence under a
    fenced transition lock, so a persisted enable intent becomes a live, verified
    route (closing the "healthy but unrouted" gap). `--upstream` is schema-
    validated and a non-default origin requires `--confirm-credential-forwarding`.
    **Public behavior break:** the old foreground `mega proxy start` is now
    `mega proxy supervise`.
  - `@megasaver/gui`: the proxy toggle persists desired state through the shared
    control plane (also under the transition lock) and no longer owns a listener,
    clears the route, or runs osascript.

  Security hardening (CRITICAL review): the handler forwards with
  `redirect:"manual"` (a cross-origin 3xx can't re-send the API key) and answers
  the reserved health path locally (never forwarded); the route mutator fsyncs and
  preserves file mode; the usage log is 0600/0700, symlink-refusing, with a bounded
  control-char-stripped model label; the lock re-judges quarantined content so a
  live owner is never stolen; the LaunchAgent verifies the managed plist byte-exact
  and restores a backed-up legacy plist on bootstrap failure.

  Deferred (flagged): the full GUI auth bootstrap (launch capability → HttpOnly
  SameSite cookie + CSRF) and cross-process supervisor discovery (runtime.json +
  control server). The single self-driving supervisor needs neither to route.
